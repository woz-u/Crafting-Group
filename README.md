# Crafting Project Manager

This project is the Capstone for Sue Darby, Stacie Wyatt and Devine Sims through Entity Academy/Woz-U. The main app is found in the task-manager-main folder

## Executive Summary

Every crafter knows the pain of not being able to find something and spending the money on a duplicate even though they “know it’s here somewhere”. To reduce duplication of patterns, notions, fabric and other supplies for sewing & crafts, the Crafting Project Manager was born. 

The focus for this project is as follows:

- Projects
- Stash (future)
- Shopping (future)
- Budget (future)
- Dashboard

The functionality is based on a Task-Manager repo by https://github.com/Tammibriggs/Task-manager and is modded to meet the needs of the project.

## The Stack

- Node
- React
- Bootstrap
- Firebase
- Google Auth

## Workflow

- User registers with their Google account
- User Logs in
- Presented with a Dashboard with
  -   Projects, Shopping list, Budget and Stash
- Projects 
  -   UFO (Unfinished Object) 
  -   Future project with a supply list and inspiration
  -   Supplies are checked against the stash and if not found added to the shopping list (future feature)
- Shopping List (future feature)
  -   List of items to purchase to complete a project
  -   Items to refresh the stash for common items
- Stash (future feature)
  -   Shows what is in the stash
  -   Where it is stored
  -   Where it was last seen
  -   Tracks the quantity of items in the stash and adds to the shopping list when the quantity gets low (future feature)
- Budgets will show if a project is over or under a targeted budget to assist with money management.(future feature)

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
